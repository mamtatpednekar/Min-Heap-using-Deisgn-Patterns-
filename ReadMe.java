//1. We modified the test cases based on the suggestions of the assignment 1. We are now checking
//    boundary conditions as well. We have removed the failed test cases from our assignment.
//    The test cases for add include checking for null node, adding nodes, checking left,right subtree
//    nodes and size of heap.
//2. We have modified the classnames to match the Java standards.
//            3. We have implemented an ArrayList .
//4. add(), toArray() and toString() methods are implemented.
//            5. We have implemented the Strategy pattern to implement both as a min heap and a max heap. For
//    the minheap, the Node class is used whereas for the maxheap, the OperationMaxHeap class is used. The
//    methods are defined in the Strategy and the Context contains the executeStrategy. The StrategyPatternDemo
//    contains the main function with the logic.
//6. We have implemented an external iterator for the inorder traversal in the HeapIterator Class.
//7. Implemented an internal iterator in teh Node Class
//8. Null Pattern is implemented to check for Null Node. We are now able to identify null checks using
//this pattern.
//9. Implemented OddFilter with
//    OddFilter(Iterator input) - constructor
//    boolean hasNext() - returns true if the iteration has more elements that are odd integers.
//            next() - returns the next element in the iteration that is an odd integer.
//            10.Created a Decorator Pattern which will modify iterator, toString and toArray to return only
//    odd numbers.Decorator pattern allows to add a new functionality to an existing object without
//    altering its structure. This pattern makes sense since we are using the existing functionalities
//    to now return only odd numbers.
